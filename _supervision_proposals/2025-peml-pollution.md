## Motivation

This project aims to explore the injection of prior information coming from first-principle models into deep learning models to forecast time series coming from air pollution data. 

The idea is to use selected fluid dynamic models to influence the output of deep and evaluate the performance change.

## Tasks and Timeline

### Stage 1:
* Frame the air pollution forecasting problem in terms physics enhance machine learning.
* Review the state-of-the-art and proposed solutions in the literature;
* Familiarize with the proposed deep learning baseline.
* Brainstorm potential fluid-dynamic models to enhance the deep learning baseline.

### Stage 2:
* Plan the experiments and tests for the expected solution;
* Collect and describe environmental data related to air pollution;
* Develop a pre-processing data pipeline;
* Select meaningful features from the dataset;
* Design a proof-of-concept for potential solutions via minimum viable product concept;
* Analyze the proposed proof-of-concept.

### Stage 3: 
* Evaluate the proof-of-concept with the proposed experiments and tests;
* Benchmark the proof-of-concept against other solutions in the literature.

### Stage 4: 
* Document the problem description and solution-design methodology;
* Show the results to reviewers and non-technical audiences.
