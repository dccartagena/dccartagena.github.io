## Motivation

This project investigates the integration of first-principle fluid dynamic models into deep learning frameworks to enhance air pollution time series forecasting. By leveraging these models, we aim to guide the learning process of neural networks, hypothesizing that this will improve their ability to capture pollutant dispersion patterns. The approach will be evaluated by comparing the performance of standard deep learning models with their physics-enhanced counterparts, assessing improvements in prediction accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability.

This project is the continuation of [Design of a Deep Learning approach to simulate and forecast smog clouds](/ideas-projects/2022-air-medellin).
