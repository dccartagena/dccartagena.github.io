## Motivation
Skills in artificial intelligence and data science are becoming more relevant in today’s labour market[^1]. Furthermore, the advances in artificial intelligence are reaching an audience beyond experts in the field[^2]. Thus, it is becoming more important to develop social appropriation strategies for the research in artificial intelligence. This project aims to develop tools to teach machine learning concepts with hands-on approach focusing on teenagers above 16 years old. The resulting tools are expected to catch and maintain the motivation of the students while teaching abstract concepts in an easy-to-follow way.

## Tasks and Timeline

### Stage 1:
* Define the problem of pedagogy of machine learning in high schools;
* Delimitate the solution concept;
* Review current tools utilized in machine learning teaching for universities and high schools;
* Brainstorm potential solutions for the problem.

### Stage 2:
* Plan the experiments and test for the expected solution;
* Propose a new tool for machine learning education with an emphasis on high school;
* Design a proof-of-concept for potential solutions via minimum viable product concept;
* Analyze the proposed proof-of-concept.

### Stage 3: 
* Evaluate the proof-of-concept with the proposed experiments and tests;
* Benchmark the proof-of-concept against other solutions in the literature.

### Stage 4: 
* Document the problem description and solution-design methodology;
* Show the results to reviewers and non-technical audiences.

## Expected Outcomes

### Mandatory Products
* Educational material for machine learning in high schools;
* Software and hardware with documentation associated with the project;
* Technical report with problem description, proposed solutions, experimental results, and project conclusions by following the University guidelines;
* A public dissertation following the University guidelines.

### Optional Products
* Summary paper from the technical report suitable for conferences or journals;
* 3-minute elevator pitch video of the project;
* Blog post or video explaining the problem and proposed solution for a general audience.
