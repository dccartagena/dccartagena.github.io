## Proposed Solution
TBA

## Tasks and Timeline

### Stage 1:
* Define the problem 
* Delimitate the solution concept.
* Review the state-of-the-art and proposed solutions in the literature.
* Brainstorm potential solutions for the problem.

### Stage 2:
* Plan the experiments and test for the expected solution.
* Design a proof-of-concept for potential solutions via minimum viable product concept.
* Analyze the proposed proof-of-concept.

### Stage 3: 
* Evaluate the proof-of-concept with the proposed experiments and tests.
* Benchmark the proof-of-concept against other solutions in the literature.

### Stage 4: 
* Document the problem description and solution-design methodology
* Show the results to reviewers and non-technical audiences

## Expected Outcomes

### Mandatory Products
* Educational material for machine learning in high schools.
* Software and hardware with documentation associated with the project.
* Technical report with problem description, proposed solutions, experimental results, and project conclusions by following the University guidelines.
* A public dissertation following the University guidelines.

### Optional Products
* Summary paper from the technical report suitable for conferences or journals
* 3-minute elevator pitch video of the project
* Blog post or video explaining the problem and proposed solution for a general audience
