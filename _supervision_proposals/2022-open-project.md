## Problem
If you have a problem or idea, we may consider it for your bachelor’s or master's project. For this purpose, prepare a 10-minute elevator pitch of the idea and a literature review of the problem you aim to study. We may also discuss if I am a suitable candidate to supervise your project.

My areas of interest for this open project are reinforcement learning, deep learning, estimation and control, and applications in cyber-physical systems. Visit the <a href="/publications/">Publications</a> or <a href="/portfolio/">Projects</a> tabs for more information about my work.

## First Step: Choosing a Project

Open projects require an extra step to understand the context behind the problem or motivation, so, I follow the Heilmeier questionnaire to evaluate ideas:

* What are you trying to do? You should be able to explain your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
* How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
* What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?
* Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
* What are the risks?
* How much will it cost?
* How long will it take?
* What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

## Tasks and Timeline

### Stage 1:
* Define the problem;
* Delimitate the solution concept;
* Review the state-of-the-art and proposed solutions in the literature;
* Brainstorm potential solutions for the problem.

### Stage 2:
* Plan the experiments and test for the expected solution;
* Design a proof-of-concept for potential solutions via minimum viable product concept;
* Analyze the proposed proof-of-concept.

### Stage 3: 
* Evaluate the proof-of-concept with the proposed experiments and tests;
* Benchmark the proof-of-concept against other solutions in the literature.

### Stage 4: 
* Document the problem description and solution-design methodology;
* Show the results to reviewers and non-technical audiences.

## Expected Outcomes

### Mandatory Products
* Technical report with problem description, proposed solutions, experimental results, and project conclusions by following the University guidelines;
* Software and hardware with documentation associated with the project;
* A public dissertation following the University guidelines.

### Optional Products
* Summary paper from the technical report suitable for conferences or journals;
* 3-minute elevator pitch video of the project;
* Blog post or video explaining the problem and proposed solution for a general audience.

## Bibliography
As you propose the project, send me at least one (1) survey paper with a well-described problem and state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, if you consider that the project requires special topics out of the bachelor’s or master's curriculum, send me the proposed literature
