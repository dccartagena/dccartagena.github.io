## Proposed Solution
TBA

## Tasks and Timeline

### Stage 1:
* Define the estimation problem for smog cloud dynamics
* Delimitate the solution concept
* Review the state-of-the-art and proposed solutions in the literature
* Brainstorm potential deep learning-based solutions for the problem

### Stage 2:
* Plan the experiments and test for the expected solution
* Describe the dataset
* Develop a pre-processing data methodology
* Select meaningful features from the dataset
* Design a proof-of-concept for potential solutions via minimum viable product concept
* Analyze the proposed proof-of-concept

### Stage 3: 
* Evaluate the proof-of-concept with the proposed experiments and tests
* Benchmark the proof-of-concept against other solutions in the literature

### Stage 4: 
* Document the problem description and solution-design methodology
* Show the results to reviewers and non-technical audiences

## Expected Outcomes

### Mandatory Products
* Simulation of smog clouds forecasting
* Mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm
* Software with documentation associated with the project
* Technical report with problem description, proposed solutions, experimental results, and project conclusions by following the University guidelines
* A public dissertation following the University guidelines

### Optional Products
* Summary paper from the technical report suitable for conferences or journals
* 3-minute elevator pitch video of the project
* Blog post or video explaining the problem and proposed solution for a general audience
