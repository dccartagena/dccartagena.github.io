## Tasks and Timeline

### Stage 1:
* Define the reinforcement learning problem in a video games setting with a focus on football;
* Delimitate the solution concept to particular scenarios;
* Review the state-of-the-art and proposed solutions in the literature;
* Brainstorm potential solutions for the problem.

### Stage 2:
* Plan the experiments and test for the expected solution;
* Set up a suitable football environment for experimentation;
* Develop a pre-processing data methodology;
* Select meaningful features from the dataset;
* Design a proof-of-concept for potential solutions via minimum viable product concept;
* Analyze the proposed proof-of-concept.

### Stage 3: 
* Evaluate the proof-of-concept with the proposed experiments and tests;
* Benchmark the proof-of-concept against other solutions in the literature.

### Stage 4: 
* Document the problem description and solution-design methodology;
* Show the results to reviewers and non-technical audiences.

## Expected Outcomes

### Mandatory Products
* An rl agent capable of playing football in video games;
* Benchmark with other rl algorithms in the literature;
* Mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm;
* Software with documentation associated with the project;
* Technical report with problem description, proposed solutions, experimental results, and project conclusions by following the University guidelines;
* A public dissertation following the University guidelines.

### Optional Products
* Summary paper from the technical report suitable for conferences or journals;
* 3-minute elevator pitch video of the project;
* Blog post or video explaining the problem and proposed solution for a general audience.
