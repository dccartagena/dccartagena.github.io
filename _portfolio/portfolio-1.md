My Ph.D. project aims to explore novel techniques in **Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning** for adaptive control to prevent *fatal states* in large-scale systems where some control actions may end up in undesired consequences and dangerous situations. The proposed applications for this research are *water distribution networks* and *aquaponic systems*, with the possibility of exploring other application domains, e.g. networked collaborative robots and video-games. This approach proposes novel cooperative in-network data processing techniques and provides robust data analytics, learning and control with human-in-the-loop.
