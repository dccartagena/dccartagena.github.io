This poem is dedicated to someone who gave me the best days of my childhood.

***Keywords*** --- poetry.

*These are some words I wanted to tell you,*\
*As I have not seen you for a year,*\
*When my eyes get lost in the thoughts,*\
*Your image is there waiting with peace.*

*I am glad you are with her again,*\
*As your mind was lost when she moved away,*\
*We missed her together,*\
*And she is your true love.*

*Do you keep in touch with your daughter?*\
*She is always asking about you,*\
*Maybe, try to ring her tonight,*\
*And tell her about your new world.*

*It will take me a while to visit you,*\
*Maybe decades and a long journey,*\
*For sure, we will see each other again,*\
*Meanwhile, let me tell you, I miss you.*
