title:  "Embrace the winter"
---

I come from Medellin, Colombia, a well known city for flowers, coffee, and an amazing weather. Without joking, the average temperature in Medellin is between 17°C to 28°C. Furthermore, there are two seasons in Colombia: dry and rainy. On dry season, you may experience a shinny and clear sky every day. However when it is rainy season, you may expect a swimming pool of the size of a city and blocks of ice falling from the sky. The tropical weather is amazing, don't you think so? In this post, I want to talk about the daily life of a tropical-country guy on winter season.

Notice that I have not mentioned snow anywhere yet. Indeed, I tasted snow for the first time when I visited El nevado del Ruiz in Caldas, Colombia, at the age of 10 years old.
