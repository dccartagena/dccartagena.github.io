title:  "Embrace the winter as someone from the tropics"
---

I come from Medellin, Colombia, a well-known city for flowers, coffee, and fantastic weather. The average temperature in Medellin is between 17°C to 28°C. Furthermore, there are two seasons in Colombia: dry and rainy. During the dry season, you may experience a shiny and clear sky daily. However, when it is the rainy season, you may expect a swimming pool the size of a city and blocks of ice falling from the sky. The tropical weather is terrific, don't you think so? In this post, I want to talk about the daily life of a tropical-country guy during the winter season.

***Keywords*** --- winter, weather, health.

## From the eternal spring city to the Canadian winter
Notice that I have not mentioned snow anywhere yet. Indeed, I tasted snow for the first time when I visited El Nevado del Ruiz in Caldas, Colombia, at 10 years old. And I experience a complete season below 0°C during my internship in Germany in the 2015 winter. The first winter is always interesting to experience; it is as white as in the Christmas movies. But for someone who does not know about winter clothes or living with snow, there were several problems on the table. For example, my shoes were not waterproof nor large enough to avoid snow getting into my feet. However, I survived and enjoyed the experience. The real challenge began in Canada. Oh, Canada! I love it, but the Canadian winter is harsh.

My first experience with the Canadian winter was on January 1st, 2018. The moment I arrived at Toronto airport, the breeze touched my nose, and damn! It was cold. 

Talk about the case of hypothermia.

## The lack of vitamin D
Talk about winter depression and shorter days.

## Clothes and the layers theory
Talk about layers, winter jackets and shoes, spikes, and general clothing like scarf and gloves.

My outfit during the first days in Canada was an autumn jacket, t-shirt, jeans, and converse-type shoes in place with -17°C and snow until the knee. At least I had a hat, scarf, and gloves; otherwise, the situation would be worse. I am sure that the readers who live in countries with winter are in pain right or facepalm mode now. Indeed, when my master's supervisor saw me wearing those clothes, he took me to the nearest shopping center to buy winter shoes and a jacket. But for someone whose hometown does not reach temperatures below 10°C, this requires an explanation. 

* **Winter jackets** differ from those we see on the streets in Medellin. They have thermal insulation with low heat-conductivity materials like plumage or synthetic polyester; in practical terms, they are fluffier than a jacket for autumn weather.

* Also, for your upper part, wear a **winter hat** and a **scarf** to cover your mouth, ears, and nose. **Ear muffs** are another option if you are not a fan of hats. And remember to wear comfortable **gloves**.

* The **winter shoes** must be waterproof because snow is typically frozen water. Once the snow touches your skin, it melts, and your socks are wet; in the worst-case scenario, you get frostbite on your feet. If possible, the shoes should be at the height of your ankle or more. You want to avoid snow inside your shoes. Also, you may want to wear **thick and large socks** to keep your feet warm.

* To overcome the ice on the streets, you must wear **spikes** with the shoes. More information is in the next section.

* Although **winter pants** are a thing, your legs will feel cold if you stay outside for an extended time. They are recommended if you are hiking or doing winter sports. But for daily life, a jean with long underwear is far enough.

* Depending on the weather, you may want to protect your body with different **layers of clothes**, e.g., a t-shirt, sweater, and winter jacket. For example, on a typical day in the south of Norway at -7°C, I wear a t-shirt with a winter jacket. But I would add the sweater layer in a place like Kingston or Montreal, where the temperature reaches -25°C.

## The infamous freezing rain
No one talks about freezing rain; this is the most kept secret from the winter. What happens when there is frozen water in a place a little bit above 0°C? It melts. And what happens if the temperature is below 0°C again? The water freezes, but not in the shape of snow, it freezes as ice. Now, you imagine walking on ice from your house to the university. Let me give you the following video as an example:

<div>

It is not surprising that the emergency rooms are full after freezing rain. And hip fractures in older adults are common injuries in this scenario. But do not worry, the societies from cold weather have solved this problem with spikes for shoes and salt in the streets. You may buy those shoe spikes in the supermarkets from around November, and they can be attached to a variety of shoes. It is uncomfortable to walk under those conditions, but at least we are safe. Below, you may find an image of the spikes and shoes with them.

Now, the next question arises. What about driving or biking when the streets are covered with ice? Do not worry again; there are winter tires for cars and bikes. But driving on ice is horrifying as it is easy to lose control of the vehicle. Nevertheless, cars have safety systems for winter environments, like the anti-lock braking system and electronic stability control. Always check that those systems are turned on before driving. So, drive with a lot of caution, keep your distance from the other cars, and if possible, take lessons for driving in winter conditions. 

## Winter sports
Let me start this section with a simple statement, I hate skiing. It is one of the scariest activities I have ever tried in my life, and says the guy who has jumped from bridges and flown in paragliding. Sorry to my fellow Norwegians about such a statement because the ski is the national sport in the country.

## Some final thoughts
A close friend once told me, "Never eat yellow snow," and I keep those wise words in my heart. In addition, never lick a piece of metal during winter, I did with a transit sign for the meme, and it was painful.
