title:  "Let us talk about personal finances"
---

One of my secret passions is finance. So, I would like to talk about personal finances and some tips for saving money. Furthermore, as someone who has made stupid decisions in life, I want to share my experiences and lessons from those mistakes. Although this post is not financial advice of any kind, I think it is worth sharing stories about finance and money as it looks like a tabu in today's society.

My relationship with money
============================================
I would describe myself as cheap, who likes to visit discount stores and enjoys buying food from the 50%-off section. Perhaps, there are a few exceptions to my strict policy about money, such as video games and helping my family.

## Becoming a friend with the banks

## The emergency fund

## I like the stoks âœ‹ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤š
Let me start this section with the following thought: I have lost a lot of money in the stocks, but it has worth every cent. I began to invest in funds and stocks during the 2020 pandemic. I was pretty desperate to find ways to pay my student loan. And I came across a colleague investing in Norwegian stocks; he taught me the basics, and I started to self-learn about the market and financial terms. 

My first big investment was in companies in the healthcare, electronics, and software sector. I hit the jackpot with the last two; however, with the healthcare sector, my strategy was to naive. I thought that vaccine manufacturers would make a lot of money during a global pandemic, but I entered my position too early and left it too fast. Let me explain, my position started when the Covid-vaccine was on early research and most of the investments in those companies were going to that particular purpose. Clearly, the companies did not get return from the vaccine until they started to sell it to the world. And that is my second mistake, I left my position before the vaccine was approved. Worth the lesson, as I learned that investing requires pacience and attention to small details.

As of today, I follow an investing simpler investing strategy: put my money in strong funds and stocks of companies with a broad market.
