I am working on **Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning** techniques for food production and water distribution systems. My research interests include data-driven control and machine learning algorithms for building **trustworthy artificial intelligence** agents in safety-critical mechatronics systems. 

Likewise, my motivation moves towards **innovation and co-creation** processes that involve knowledge transfer between universities and research centres with the industry and society. Outside academia, I enjoy analyzing geopolitics and finance news and develop investment strategies based on signal processing techniques. I support voluntary causes related to education and science dissemination to engage young people in research.
